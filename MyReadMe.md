Homework 2: CSS Bootstrap 

My website is build around 3 HTML files: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html. Each of them establish and hold necessary info
for my portfolio. The first thing I did to the site was add a nav bar, which I was able to reverse the color by tinkering with it. I then linked
the 3 pages to together using the images in the navbar for each. After, I added a universal background to the webpages and also made the image 
responsive. The first webpage that I finished was the contact page. The two inputs I used from bootstrap were capable of being responsive on their
own. After holding placeholder images to the portfolio page and a profile picture to the main page, the last thing I had to do was make my collapse nav bar work. However, the main problem I'm having is that my navbar text at the top is at different locations on each page. I was going to use
a background as well, but I was having trouble getting it to stretch all the way vertically on all devices. The code for it is 
noted out in my styles.css folder.
