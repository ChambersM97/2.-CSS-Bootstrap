Homework 2: CSS Bootstrap 

My website is build around 3 HTML files: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html. Each of them establish and hold necessary info
for my portfolio. The first thing I did to the site was add a nav bar, which I was able to reverse the color by tinkering with it. I then linked
the 3 pages to together using the images in the navbar for each. After, I added a universal background to the webpages and also made the image 
responsive.
